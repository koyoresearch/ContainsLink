# ContainsLink
ContainsLink will find links in PDF, Word, Excel, and text files in a user specified directory and its sub-directories.
It will write the links to a log file on the user's desktop.

This tool is helpful when you need to update documentation when moving a website, file share, or Sharepoint site.

Crawl files for links; find links in files.
